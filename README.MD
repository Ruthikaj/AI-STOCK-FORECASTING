Project Description

The Advanced Stock Price Forecasting Using a Hybrid Model of Numerical and Textual Analysis project involves a comprehensive approach to predicting stock prices using both numerical data and textual analysis. The project components include:

    Data Collection and Storage: We gathered historical stock data of major companies and stored it in an InfluxDB database to efficiently handle large-scale time-series data.

    Data Visualization: A Grafana dashboard has been set up for real-time visualization of stock prices and analysis results, enhancing data interpretation and decision-making processes.

    Textual Analysis for Enhanced Forecasting: We utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries, such as NLTK and spaCy, to analyze financial news and reports. This component complements numerical analysis to improve the accuracy of our hybrid forecasting model.

    Machine Learning Models: The project used models including Naive Bayes, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to process both numerical and textual data, creating a robust and comprehensive stock prediction system.

    Reddit Chatbot Data Visualization Integration: The project involved adding static and interactive plots to represent chatbot data from Reddit, using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize user interactions, message frequency, and topic distribution effectively.

    Collaboration and Project Management: The repository includes contributions from all team members with well-organized tasks, ensuring seamless collaboration and effective version control.
