Here's a **complete, professional, and interview-ready** explanation of your project:  
**📈 Real-Time Stock Prediction using AI & Machine Learning**  
— tailored to answer all the technical interview questions you've listed:

### 💡 **What ML and DL models did you implement?**

We implemented a hybrid model combining:
- **Classical ML models**:  
  - **Random Forest Regressor**  
  - **XGBoost**  
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Deep Learning models**:  
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
  - **Bidirectional LSTM**  
  - **Transformer-based attention models**  

These models were selected to handle **non-linearity, temporal dependencies, and high-frequency noise** in stock time series data.

### 🧮 **Linear Regression Code Example & Explanation**  

Here’s how we used **Linear Regression** as a baseline model:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('stocks.csv')  # Assume it contains 'Date' and 'Close'
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data['Days'] = (data['Date'] - data['Date'].min()).dt.days

# Prepare input and output
X = data[['Days']]  # Independent variable
y = data['Close']   # Dependent variable

# Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Linear Regression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
```

📌 **Explanation**:
- We converted **dates into numeric days** to serve as features.
- Applied `LinearRegression` to map `Days` ➝ `Stock Price`.
- This is a **baseline model** to compare against more complex architectures like LSTM.

### 🌲 What are Random Forests and SVMs?

#### 🔹 **Random Forest**
- **Ensemble of decision trees** built on random subsets of data.
- Uses **majority voting (classification)** or **average prediction (regression)**.
- Helps reduce **overfitting** by combining multiple weak learners.

#### 🔹 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Works by finding the **optimal hyperplane** that separates data points of different classes.
- For regression, SVM tries to fit the data within a **margin of tolerance (epsilon-insensitive tube)**.
- Uses **kernel trick** to handle non-linear relationships.

### 📊 How did you use NumPy and Pandas?

✅ **Pandas**:
- Used for **data ingestion**, cleaning, merging multiple CSVs, and generating rolling statistics (`rolling().mean()`).
- Handled **time series conversion**, resampling (`resample('1D')`), and shifting (`shift()` for lag features).

✅ **NumPy**:
- Efficiently handled large matrix operations for LSTM input shaping.
- Used `np.array()` to convert DataFrame sequences to 3D input shape `[samples, timesteps, features]`.

### 🔁 How many epochs did you use during training, and why?

We typically trained the deep learning models for:
- **LSTM/RNNs**: 50–100 epochs
- **Transformer**: 40–60 epochs

We used **early stopping** with a patience of 5 epochs to avoid overfitting. The number of epochs was tuned using validation loss trends.

---

### 📦 Did you work with any known datasets? What were their dimensions?

Yes, we used:
- **Yahoo Finance** (via `yfinance` API) — e.g., Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Nifty50 index.
- Dataset dimension:  
  - 5+ years of data  
  - ~1,250 rows (daily),  
  - Features: `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing Techniques

Key preprocessing steps:

| Step                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Handling Missing Values  | Used forward fill (`fillna(method='ffill')`)                                |
| Feature Scaling          | Applied `MinMaxScaler` for LSTM models (range 0–1)                          |
| Lag Features             | Created `t-1`, `t-2` shifts to capture historical dependencies              |
| Rolling Windows          | Calculated 7-day and 14-day rolling means and standard deviations           |
| Categorical Encoding     | For sector-wise data, used `LabelEncoder`                                   |
| Train-Test Split         | Used **TimeSeriesSplit** (not random shuffle) to preserve time dependencies |
